        <p>Hi, I'm Laura and I love reading. I decided to create this website to share what I think about the books I read and other things.</p>

        <h3 id="recensionilibri">Book recommendations</h3>
        <p id="vicino">I've always loved reading, and in 2017 I opened an Instagram account (if you want to see it it's @rana_lettrice, the recommendations are in Italian, but you might enjoy my photos .^.) where I used to recommend books. But I don't like Instagram anymore so I deleted Instagram from my phone, I learnt how to create websites and I started this blog.<br> I am from Italy and I read mostly Italian books, but sometimes (in fact, everytime I can find a book in English in the library or online by an author I think I can understand well enough) I read in English too. I wouldn't post here in the English section Italian books because of the quotes: I wouldn't translate them right and I don't want to disrespect the author by quoting him wrong.<br>By the way, my recommendations will contain:
        </p>
        <ul id="vicino">
            <li>the plot of the book, of course</li>
            <li>my opinion on the book</li>
            <li>some nice quotes</li>
            <li>a part where I will say my thoughts in some scenes (this part will contain spoilers)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 id="recensionifilm"> Movie or TV show recommendations</h3>
        <p id="vicino">On the Instagram account, I used to recommend also movies and TV shows. <br>
        I don't like talking about movies as I like talking about books, but eventually I recommend TV shows and movies. This kind of recommendations won't be frequent because I watch really few movies and I'm really slow wth TV shows, I don't have much time.</p>
        
        <h3 id="altricontenuti">Other topics</h3>
        <p id="vicino"> I would also like to have a "column": I would post when I have a topic idea. I know I won't have ideas and inpiration to keep an active column, but I encourage you to write me some topic ideas <a href="https://tellonym.me/ranalettrice">here</a>. Write me everything you want me to talk about, "serious" things or fandom things. </p>
